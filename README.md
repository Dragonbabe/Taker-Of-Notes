## General Info

This project was an example using Express to create a CLI to take notes and then save them and then also delete them. This project was developing the back-end logic and the functionality behind the files. It was tying all of the various files together and making sure they were all communicating together.

## User Story

As a user with a busy life full of work, school, robots, animals, Pathfinder, rock climbing and trail running, I often find myself needing to remember many different schedules and places that I need to be. I can't remember all those things in this leaky vessel of a mind!
This application will enable me to always have something that saves all of my notes and things that are about to happen in my life and then as soon as I complete them I can delete them!

## Summary

A person can type in a note title and then also also paragraphs of information that they would like to store in notes. The information they wrote down can then be stored and after hitting the save button on the top right corner and upon doing that the note they just made will save into a column on the left hand side of the page
